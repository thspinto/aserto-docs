# Authentication vs Authorization

Authentication and Authorization are two terms that are often thought of as the same thing. In this article we'll attempt to clarify what each of these terms mean and how they differ. In order to have a secure system, you need both. At a 25000 foot level, **Authentication** is focused on _WHO you are_ and **Authorization** is focused on _WHAT you can do_.

# Authentication

Authentication's primary concern is the user's identity. Is the person trying to access the system who they claim to be? Do they have valid credentials? Can they prove it? Are they using a registered device and in a known location? Have they tried to login recently from two different locations? 

Modern Authentication platforms or Identity Providers (IDP) like Auth0, Cognito, Azure AD, and more ask these questions for us. They are the front-line defense for a system. Whenever you try to use a secure system, the first thing you'll hit is a login screen, and that is where authentication kicks in. The IDP will require you to login using credentials such as a username and password, a social login (Google, Github, LinkedIn), Passwordless, or Single Sign On. Additionally it may use Multi-factor Authentication such as SMS or an Authenticator app to further provide proofs. The IDP will go deeper and look at the device you are using, where you are attempting to login from, your IP address, and more. Once you are authenticated, the IDP will issue a token (commonly a JWT) that the client app can then use for subsequent calls. 

Authentication doesn't end at login. Any time an attempt is made to access any protected resource in the app (like a secure web page or API endpoint), the IDP will ensure the client (such as the browser) has sent valid credentials. If the credentials are invalid, expired, or missing, then the request will be denied.

Once you have been authenticated the next question is what are you allowed to do? This is where Authorization comes in.

# Authorization

Authorization is concerned with access control, controlling the data users have access to and the actions they can perform. Are they allowed to view another employee's social security numbers or salary? Can they edit a specific document? Can they create purchase orders? Authorization Systems answer these questions. They do this by looking at a user's permissions using a variety of different authorization models. The most traditional model is Role Based Access Control or RBAC. In an RBAC system permissions are aggregated into roles which are assigned to users or groups. An example of permissions is view, edit, and delete, while examples of roles are viewer, editor, or admin.  

Regardless of the model chosen, the authorization system will look up details about the user and figure out their permissions. It will then look at the resource they are attempting to access and what the required permissions are. Finally, it will make the determination if the user has the required permissions to allow the request. 

These rules for access are the Authorization Policy. Modern Authorization systems, like Aserto, allow you to externalize the policy and the permissions for different parts of the system from your code. They integrate with the IDP to pull down corporate directory information, including roles, permissions, and group membership. 

# Why you need both

Authentication is the front-door to your system. It helps prevent unwanted actors from getting in unless they have proper credentials. Authorization controls the actions of the user once they get in. It says where they can go, what they can see, and what they can do. If credentials are compromised, Authorization is your next line of defense. It ensures that both well-meaning users and bad actors can't harm the system or compromise your customer's data. A modern Authorization system like Aserto helps here and provides tools to make it easier to manage your users and give them the right permissions appropriate for their role within your organization.
